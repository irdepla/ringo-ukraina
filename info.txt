In JavaScript, if, else if, and else statements are used for conditional logic to control the flow of a program based on certain conditions.

1. if Statement:
The if statement checks a condition, and if it evaluates to true, the block of code inside the if statement is executed.

else if Statement:
After an if block, you can use else if to check another condition if the first one is false. You can have multiple else if statements.



The else statement is optional and runs if none of the previous if or else if conditions are true.

Comparison operators are used to compare two values and return a boolean (true or false) result. They are essential for making decisions in your code, especially in if or switch statements.

List of Comparison Operators:
== (Equal to):

Compares two values for equality, but performs type conversion if needed.
Example: 5 == '5' is true (because of type conversion).
=== (Strict equal to):

Compares two values for equality without type conversion. Both type and value must be the same.
Example: 5 === '5' is false (because one is a number, the other is a string).
!= (Not equal to):

Compares two values for inequality, performing type conversion.
Example: 5 != '5' is false (since after conversion they are considered equal).
!== (Strict not equal to):

Compares two values for inequality without type conversion.
Example: 5 !== '5' is true (because the types differ).
> (Greater than):

Checks if the left value is greater than the right.
Example: 10 > 5 is true.
>= (Greater than or equal to):

Checks if the left value is greater than or equal to the right.
Example: 10 >= 10 is true.
< (Less than):

Checks if the left value is less than the right.
Example: 5 < 10 is true.
<= (Less than or equal to):

Checks if the left value is less than or equal to the right.
Example: 5 <= 5 is true.


A switch statement is a way to execute different pieces of code based on the value of a variable or expression. Itâ€™s particularly useful when you have a single variable that can have multiple possible values, and you want to perform different actions for each value.

How Does It Work?
Start with a variable or expression: You provide a variable or an expression you want to evaluate.
Define multiple cases: Each case checks if the variable or expression matches a specific value.
Execute code for the matching case: When a match is found, the code inside that case runs.
Use break: After executing the matching case, you usually use break to stop further checking of cases.
Optional default case: If none of the cases match, you can include a default case that runs.
